### **5. Intellectual Property & Breaches**

- All code, content, and data produced under Readflo are jointly owned by the company/founding team.
    
- **Any use of these assets for private purposes** will:
    
    - Require **monetary compensation** at a fair valuation

- Founders may not work on competing projects during collaboration and for **12 months after exit**.
    

---

### **7. KPI-Based Performance Commitment**

Progress will be tracked based on **KPI milestones**, not working hours.

**Example Milestones:**

- Q2: 500 test users onboarded

→ Founders may **pause or terminate the project** by mutual agreement

#### 9.3. Exit Rights
