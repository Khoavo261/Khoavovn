### **1. Fundraising Principles**

All external fundraising activities (angel investors, seed funds, VCs, grants, crowdfunding, etc.) **must be approved by both founders in writing or through formal confirmation via email.**

- In case of any investment proposal, the founding team shall jointly:
    
    - Evaluate strategic fit, value alignment, and proposed terms
        
    - Prepare fundraising materials: pitch deck, project valuation, cap table
        
    - Participate in negotiations and align on key terms
        

**No founder is allowed to unilaterally sell company shares to any third party** without mutual written consent.

- Any equity changes after a funding round must be reflected in:
    
    - The updated cap table
        
    - Shareholder agreements (if applicable)
        
    - Revised vesting schedules (if necessary)

### **2. Capital Usage Process**

Any use of project funds in Readflo must follow the principles and structured workflow outlined below:

#### a) **Capital Usage Principles**

- It is strictly prohibited to use project funds for **personal purposes or non-agreed items** outside the public plan.

#### b) **Capital Usage Proposal Workflow**

1. **Submit a written proposal (via Slack/Discord with a timestamp) at least _3 days_ before the planned expense.**
    
2. The proposal must include:
    
    - Purpose of the expense
        
    - Requested amount
        
    - Planned date of usage
        
    - Expected outcome or risks (if any)
        
3. Both founders must **review and approve within 48 hours**, or suggest adjustments.
    

> ðŸ“Œ In urgent cases, the expense can proceed immediately but must be **reported within 24 hours** with justification and documented in writing internally.

#### c) **Capital Disbursement Rules**

- Once approved, the requester may:
    
    - Receive a transfer from the project account
        
    - Or advance payment personally and get reimbursed later (with valid receipts/invoices)
        
- **Reimbursements** must be processed within **10 working days** after approval and receipt submission.

#### d) **Tracking & Documentation**

- All expenses must be recorded in a **shared expense tracking sheet** (Google Sheet / Notion).
    
- At the end of each month, a brief report should be compiled including:
    
    - Total amount spent
        
    - Expense breakdown
        
    - Notes for internal verification

### **10.3. Shared Account & Financial Transparency**

- All project-related cash flow (investment, revenue, expenses) **must go through a bank account or e-wallet registered under the company legal entity** (or joint representative if a legal entity is not yet formed).
    
- If a founder **covers expenses personally**, those expenses must:
    
    - Be fully recorded in internal financial reports
        
    - Be reimbursed within 30 days (or according to the agreed schedule)
        
- Cash flow and financial reports must be updated **monthly or quarterly**.
